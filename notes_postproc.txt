DML notes for post processing on Sat 18 Jul
======================================================
In the spreadsheet:FlightlogTracker.xlsx in the Target worksheet:

1. I highlighted in yellow the flights that I found data files for and double checked for alignment of data in folders and spreadsheet entry.
2. I changed the input in the column COG. It is now one of these: 
        north of L70
        over L70
        between L70 and L72
        over L72
        south of L72
3. I changed the time to the time that the data folder was created.
4. I added a column for "For record", this is 'Y' if we counted the data as meeting the test case conditions.
